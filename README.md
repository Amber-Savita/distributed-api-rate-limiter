### 🚀 Built to Simulate Real-World API Infrastructure Used in Modern Distributed Systems

</div>

---

# 🔥 Overview

This project is a **Real-Time Distributed API Rate Limiter** designed to simulate how modern backend systems protect APIs from abuse, spam traffic, and overload.

The system:

✅ Tracks incoming API requests in real-time  
✅ Stores counters inside Redis  
✅ Allows only **5 requests per minute per user**  
✅ Returns **429 Too Many Requests** after limit exceeds  
✅ Uses low-latency Redis operations for ultra-fast performance  
✅ Follows modular backend engineering architecture  
✅ Demonstrates core distributed systems concepts  

---

# ⚡ Why This Project Exists

Modern systems like:

- Netflix
- Cloudflare
- Discord
- Stripe
- Uber
- AWS API Gateway

all use some form of:

- Rate Limiting
- Distributed Counters
- Traffic Protection
- API Throttling

Without rate limiting:

❌ APIs get spammed  
❌ Servers crash under heavy traffic  
❌ Bots abuse infrastructure  
❌ DDoS attacks become easier  

This project demonstrates the foundational architecture behind those systems.

```

---

## ✅ Automatic Counter Reset

Redis automatically expires counters using:

```redis
EXPIRE
```

---

# ⚡ Request Flow

# 🧮 Redis Internals

The project uses two extremely important Redis commands:

---

## Increment Request Counter

```redis
INCR user123
```

Example:

```text
0 → 1
1 → 2
2 → 3
```

---

## Auto Expire Counter

```redis
EXPIRE user123 60
```

Redis automatically deletes the counter after:

```text
60 seconds
```

This resets the rate limit window.

---

# 📡 API Documentation

# POST `/request`

---

## Request Headers

```http
Content-Type: application/json
```

---

## Request Body

{
  "user": "user123"
}
```

---

# ✅ Success Response

```json
{
  "status": "allowed"
}
```

```http
200 OK
```

---

# ❌ Rate Limited Response

```

---

# 🧪 Postman Testing

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system

### Steps

# 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Amber-Savita/distributed-api-rate-limiter.git
cd distributed-api-rate-limiter
```

---

# 2️⃣ Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t rate-limiter:latest .
```

---

# 3️⃣ Run Container

```bash
docker run -d --name rate-limiter -p 18080:18080 -p 6379:6379 rate-limiter:latest
```

**Options:**
- `-d`: Run in detached mode (background)
- `--name rate-limiter`: Container name for easy reference
- `-p 18080:18080`: Map API port
- `-p 6379:6379`: Map Redis port

---

# 4️⃣ Verify Server is Running

```bash
docker logs rate-limiter
```

Expected output:
```text
Starting distributed rate limiter...
Starting server on :18080
(2026-05-28 13:07:44) [INFO    ] Crow/master server is running at http://0.0.0.0:18080 using 8 threads
```

---

# 5️⃣ Test the API

```bash
# Test with 7 requests (first 5 allowed, 6-7 blocked)
python -c "
import urllib.request, json

url = 'http://localhost:18080/request'
print('Testing Rate Limiter API...\n')

for i in range(7):
    data = json.dumps({'user': 'test_user'}).encode('utf-8')
    req = urllib.request.Request(url, data=data, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, method='POST')
    try:
        response = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
        result = response.read().decode('utf-8')
        print(f'Request {i+1}: Status {response.status} - {result}')
    except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:
        result = e.read().decode('utf-8')
        print(f'Request {i+1}: Status {e.code} - {result}')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```text

```bash
brew install cmake hiredis asio
```

---

# 2️⃣ Start Redis

```bash
# Ubuntu/Linux
redis-server

# macOS
brew services start redis
```

Verify Redis is running:
```bash
redis-cli ping
# Expected: PONG
```

---

# 3️⃣ Build Project

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

---

# 4️⃣ Run Server

```bash
./rate_limiter
```

Expected output:

```

---

# 5️⃣ Test the API

Use the same Python test script from the Docker section above.

---

# 📈 Scalability

This project is designed around distributed systems principles.

Multiple backend servers can share the same Redis instance:

```text
              ┌──────────────┐
              │ API Server 1 │
              └──────┬───────┘
                     │
                     ▼
              ┌──────────────┐
              │    Redis     │
              └──────▲───────┘
                     │
              ┌──────┴───────┐
              │ API Server 2 │
              └──────────────┘
```

This enables:

✅ Shared request counters  
✅ Horizontal scalability  
✅ Distributed traffic management
